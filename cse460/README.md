These are different phases of the lab for the Operating Systems course.

Phase 1: Basic OS that can run one program at a time.

Phase 2: OS that can run multiple programs at a time.

Phase 3: OS that uses memory paging to run multiple programs at a time.


This project was a collaboration with Peter Chau.
